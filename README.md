This "Pop Culture Jeopardy" trivia game is a click on card style game. Each card represents a number value with a question and four answer option buttons. If the players selects the correct answer to the question, they will be awarded the said amount of points listed on the card. The card will also change color (green or red) to indicate wether that player got the answer correct (green) or wrong (red). Once all of the cards have been played, the game will end and the player has the option to restart the game.
